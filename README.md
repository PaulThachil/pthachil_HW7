a. Description of the project:
The project involves creating a web form for a Business Analytics Student Survey. This survey aims to gather information from students about their demographics, academic background, and impressions of the BAIS major.

b. Conformance to best practices for forms:
In designing the web form, several best practices for forms were followed. Firstly, clear and concise labels were provided for each input field, ensuring users understand what information is expected from them. Secondly, input validation was implemented using the required attribute for mandatory fields, preventing form submission until all required fields are filled. Additionally, appropriate input types were used for different types of data, such as text for names and email addresses, ensuring data integrity. Lastly, the form was structured logically, with related questions grouped together, making it easier for users to navigate and complete.

In addition to standard best practices for forms, special attention was given to inclusivity regarding questions about sex/gender and race/ethnicity. Firstly, the language used in the form was carefully chosen to be inclusive and respectful of diverse identities. Instead of asking for the user's "sex," which implies a binary understanding, the form asked about "gender/sex," acknowledging the complexity and diversity of gender identities. Similarly, the question about race/ethnicity was phrased in a way that allows for a wide range of responses, including options beyond traditional racial categories, such as multiracial or other.

c. User accessibility:
To ensure accessibility for all users, several measures were taken. Firstly, semantic HTML elements were used appropriately, providing screen readers and other assistive technologies with meaningful information about the structure of the form. Secondly, visual cues such as clear labels and instructions were provided, aiding users with cognitive disabilities or those using screen magnifiers. Additionally, the form was designed to be navigable using only the keyboard, allowing users who cannot use a mouse to interact with it effectively. Finally, input validation messages were provided next to each field, ensuring users are notified of any errors or missing information in a clear and timely manner, regardless of their browsing device or assistive technology.
